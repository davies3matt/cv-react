# Online Technical CV

## Introduction
Hi there! I created this website from scratch using React. Along the way I learned a lot about React, HTML and CSS. Having studied the more "back-end" langauges I thouroughly enjoyed the challenge of getting to know the designer/UI focused langauges. That being said I still added back-end functionality, like the EmailJS API for forwarding potential messages to my e-mail address and a handful of animation/transition triggers. 

I challanged myself to create all elements personally, using tutorials and templates only as guides to familiarize myself with the basic writing and syntax of CSS, HTML and JavaScript.
